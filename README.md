# tsEva #

This MATLAB toolbox contains an implementation of the Transformed-Stationary (TS) methodology for non-stationary EVA as described in Mentaschi et al. 2016. In synthesis this approach consists in (i) transforming a non-stationary time series into a stationary one to which the stationary EVA theory can be applied; and (ii) reverse-transforming the result into a non-stationary extreme value distribution.

The toolbox is free of external dependency.

A version working on MATLAB R2014b is available at the branch 0.1_R2014b of this project.
